## Training and Updating Model
1. [Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/4990fullstackai/hand-drawn-html-form-segmentation-and-detection)
2. Instructions and Environemnt to [Train the Model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uTHZAZgxSJF0kwebMIc3Ln6LfTtQaIDm?usp=sharing)
3. Once completed you should have a `best.pt` file
4. Add `best.pt` file to the model folder
5. To test you can run `$py infer.py [path-to-img]`
6. You can also test the full functionality from the web application, check main README for how to run.
7. Commit new `best.py` file if you want to keep update
